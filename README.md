# Cplusplus-Program

Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
  The project was to create a calculator for a savings account. It takes in a starting balance, monthly deposit, interest rate, and number of years. It then tells     you the amount of interest earned based on the starting amount with no monthly deposits for the selected number of years, then again including the monthly           deposits. 
What did you do particularly well?
  I fell my code worked well and was exceptionally clean and readable. I think how I layed out the menu and user interfaces was nice. 
Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
  I mixed some syntax in the code, example << endl; versus \n and I think it is a bit distracting. Also, now that I know how to use colors, some color coding would   be nice to have. 
Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
  Nothing was extremely challenging. Making sure I had the formatting on the menu correct, so it looks nice was a lttle time consuming but wasn't hard. 
What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
  This was a complete little program. It invovled thinking through the whole process and coming up with a solid plan. It was the 1st one I wanted my wife to try       out. Since this was one of my first projects everything is transferable to other projects (it is a bit basic).
How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
  I made good use of whitespaces and comments. The code flows well and is easy to follow. It is easily managed at this size but if you wanted to build it out or scale it up, using other files for functions would be smart.
